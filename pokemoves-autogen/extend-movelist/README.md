Here I put anything needed to extend a movelist in a move page.

# Roadmap
- [x] create a lua script to "invert" pokemoves-data
- [ ] create a lua script like `get-learnlist` but for moves. It should return data for python
- [ ] write some Python code to read the output of this script
- create a bot script to do the job:
  - [ ] for each page, use the lua script to get data for that move
  - [x] using that data, update the page

Then check again that everything works.
