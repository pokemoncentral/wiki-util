## Configuration and running

Configuration files are specific to every user, so
they are purposely in the .gitignore; templates are
provided in the config-templates directory though.
Every directory has two noticeable files, with an
appropriate extension:
-	_config.*_: contains the configuration for the
		current type of scripts,
-	_run.*_: loads the configuration properly and
		runs the passed script, comprising command
		line arguments.
