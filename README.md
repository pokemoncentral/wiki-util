Repo containing scripts and datas to build learnlist and movelist data modules for Pok√©mon Central Wiki.

In theory the script `do-things.sh` should handle anything, right now it doesn't but it's a useful roadmap: if you don't know what to do, read that file (there are comments).

I'm going to fix this readme with complete instructions once I finish with everything else, keeping track of operations in the magical script `do-things.sh`. What a meaningful name. I'm proud of myself for such a good name.
